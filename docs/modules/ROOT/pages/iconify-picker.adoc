The `dls-iconify-picker` is a robust custom field for Strapi v5 that allows editors to easily search, select, and manage icons from the vast [Iconify](https://iconify.design/) ecosystem.

== Features

*   **Search & Pagination**: Quickly find the right icon with a built-in search bar and efficient pagination.
*   **Visual Preview**: See exactly what you're picking with a large, clear preview area.
*   **Multi-Collection Support**: Configure which icon sets (e.g., Solar, Lucide) are available to your editors.
*   **JSON Storage**: Stores data safely as a structured JSON object.

== Configuration

Before using the picker, an administrator can configure which icon collections are available.

1.  Navigate to **Settings** -> **Iconify Picker** (or the Plugin Homepage).
2.  You will see a list of available icon sets (Diagnostic & Governance).
3.  Use the toggles to enable or disable specific collections for your editors.

== Usage Guide

To use the icon picker in the Content Manager:

1.  **Open an Entry**: Navigate to the collection type where you added the Iconify Picker field.
2.  **Select Collection**: Use the dropdown in the top-left to choose an icon set (e.g., `solar`).
3.  **Search Icons**: Type in the search bar (top-right) to filter icons by name.
4.  **Browse**: Use the pagination controls (Next, Previous, Page Numbers) to browse through the results.
5.  **Select**: Click on an icon in the grid (bottom-right).
6.  **Preview**: The selected icon will appear in the large preview box (bottom-left) along with its name.
    *   To remove a selection, click the **Remove** button in the preview area.

== Data Format

The field stores the selected icon as a JSON object, ensuring you have all the necessary metadata:

[source,json]
----
{
  "prefix": "solar",
  "icon": "box-bold",
  "value": "solar:box-bold"
}
----

This structure allows you to easily render the icon in your frontend application using the `prefix` and `icon` name.
